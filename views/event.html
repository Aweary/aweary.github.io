 --> <div class="circle"> <p>On April 11th, 2015 Brandon Dail and Teri Yesh will be getting married in Yosemite Valley, by the Lower Falls. The reception will be held at Yosemite Lodge by the Falls. Given the nature of the event and location, we wanted to outline a few important points regarding your experience in Yosemite.</p> </div> </div> </div> <!-- <div class="full-width-section mountains">

The nearest town is Mariposa, which also has a number of lodging options. Staying within the park will likely be more costly and more difficult to reserve, so if you intend to do so please act fast.</p> <p><a href="/#/lodging">Learn more.</a></p> </div> <div class="thirds-width-section"> <h1>RSVP.</h1> <div class="icon-container"><img src="./images/rsvp.9d88e06e.svg" alt="" class="icon" style="margin-top: 20%"></div> <hr> <br> <p>The event has a rather small guest cap, given that it will be at a National Park. The ceremony itself will be on a public trail, so we want to be sure we have an accurate estimation of the number of people our party will contain. Please RSVP by January 1st, 2015.</p> <p><a href="/#/rsvp">Learn more.</a></p> </div> <div class="thirds-width-section"> <h1>Gifts.</h1> <div class="icon-container"><img src="./images/registry.96e4c9be.svg" alt="" class="icon" style="margin-top: 20%"></div> <hr> <br> <p>Any and all gifts will be appreciated. Over the years we've gathered a lot of the basic household items that are traditonally gifted at a wedding. Taking this into consideration, and the fact that we will be driving to the wedding, we wanted to outline what kind of gifts we can actually use and take with us home.</p> </div> </div> <!-- <div class="full-width-section ceremony-details">
